					<h3>FOLK FESTIVAL</h3>
					<p>Ariano Folkfestival is an ethno-cultural project that was born in 1996 on
					 the initiative of a group of friends not yet thirty, who usually meet in a small provincial bar.
					 At the beginning it was a popular festival that over time has acquired the features of a real festival
					 dedicated to world music. In over twenty years it has managed to host the greatest
					 exponents of world, folk and gypsy music from all over the world, becoming, 
					 among the events dedicated to these musical genres, a point of reference 
					 in the countries of Europe and the Mediterranean. Over time,
					 the Folkfestival has been enriched with many collateral initiatives, 
					 transforming Ariano Irpino into a meeting place 
					 between different peoples and cultures, enhancing its traditional hospitality.</p>

				 	<h3>The municipal villa</h3>
					<p> is a public historical park located on the Castello hill, the highest (over 800 m a.s.l.)
				   	of the three hills on which stands the historic center of Ariano Irpino (also known as the city of the Tricolle).
 					The peculiar characteristic of the park is to develop all around the Norman castle,
					a medieval fortress that in Norman times became the residence of King Roger II who in 1140 held the Assizes of Ariano there,
					ie the first Constitution of the Kingdom of Sicily. The castle, probably built by the Lombards of Benevento,
					it remained in use for about a millennium, 
					only to be definitively abandoned at the end of the great wars of Italy in the 16th century;
					however, the civic use of residue on land that remained fully in force even in subsequent eras.
 					However, since 1838 the use of these grassy expanses is also attested as a leisure area ("recreational place"),
					although the only arboreal presence was made up of a row of lime trees (already defined at the time as "old")
					along the north-eastern side of the manor;
					few examples remain inside the Silvio Renzulli stadium circuit,
 					built in the same area in the Fascist era.
					Meanwhile some alternative projects (construction of a cemetery or a shooting range) were soon abandoned,
					since the creation of a real public garden was considered a priority.
 					To this end, after the unification of Italy, the leveling and planting works began until October 1876
					the first lot of the municipal villa was made official to the public; the park, still a short time but sheltered from
					the winds western and overlooking the mountains of Daunia, 
					it was already equipped with a fountain, fish pond and tavern.</p>
